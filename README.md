# EnergyWise

A senior-friendly energy management interface designed to help elderly users easily monitor and control their electricity consumption. This frontend demonstration showcases an accessible, intuitive platform that empowers seniors to manage their energy usage independently and confidently.

##  Project Overview

EnergyWise addresses a critical gap in energy management technology by creating an interface specifically designed for elderly users. With large text, simple navigation, clear visuals, and voice assistance capabilities, this **proof-of-concept frontend application** demonstrates how technology can be made accessible to seniors who often struggle with complex digital interfaces.

##  Why EnergyWise Matters for Seniors

Many elderly people face unique challenges with electricity management:
- **Difficulty reading small text** on complex energy meters and bills
- **Confusion with digital interfaces** and multiple navigation menus
- **Physical limitations** that make it hard to check multiple rooms or appliances
- **Cognitive challenges** in understanding complex data and graphs
- **Fixed incomes** making energy cost monitoring crucial
- **Safety concerns** about leaving appliances on accidentally
- **Living alone** without immediate help for technical issues

EnergyWise makes energy management simple, safe, and stress-free for elderly users.
